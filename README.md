# Spotipi (Spotify UI Clone)
## Side Task for Generasi Gigih 3.0 ðŸ“‘

Hello coders ðŸ‘‹, in this repo i want to share my side task/challenge about creating a music web-app layout to practice layouting skill using CSS. In brief, I mainly use vanilla CSS3 and HTML5 only (no-functionalities yet) in order to learn and understand the fundamental concept of web layouting using modern vanilla CSS technology such as flexbox, grid, and media querries. For the UI design itself I am inspired by Spotify, one of wordlwidely well-known music platform.

## Techs ðŸ¦¾

- HTML5
- CSS 3

## Features ðŸ’¡

- Modern, Clean UI Design 
- Responsive Design
- Micro interaction (hover state, ease animation)

Despite it's not functional, I've a plan in the future to make this become a functional web-app that could play some music so the user could enjoy listening to their favourite music/playlist. If you have some suggestion/any advice to help me learn about CSS layouting in more efficient way just contact me directly via my Email/Discord below.
